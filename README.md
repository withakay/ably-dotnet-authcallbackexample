# ably-dotnet-authcallbackexample

A basic end-to-end example of how to use AuthCallback with ably-dotnet and dotnet core.

To get started open a terminal and `cd` to the webApp folder and start the web app using the command below (you will need the .Net core SDK installed and an Ably API key).

```
ABLY_API_KEY=<yourkey> dotnet run
```

Now open another termial session (leaving one just created open) and `cd` to the example folder and run

```
dotnet run
```
